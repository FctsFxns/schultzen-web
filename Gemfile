# They will need to clone the project and execute
# the bin/setup script on their machine and then
# set the credential values on _glynn.yml file

# Set glynn to 1.2.2 version rather than the last one
# since it includes the delete missing files on server
# which is dangerous and is not working, causing the project
# to bankrupcy. ????
