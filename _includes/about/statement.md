# The Artist Says

Christina Schultz (1972) is a transdisciplinary artist, oral performer and linguistic nomad. Her preferred art forms are: *the voice*, *scenic interpretation* and *drawings*. She develops collaborative projects motivated by the love for people, their desires and their doubts. The constructions of her stories are based on the wholeness of error, the knowledge of the stigmatized and the beauty of clumsiness.
With long term collaborations she explores the possibilities of collectivity through *choir work*, *poetry* and *physical movement* as sources of community knowledge.

I am based in Barcelona since more then 20 years. If you'd like to know more, please don't hesitate to write me a card, a letter, a [mail](mailto:contact@christinaschultz.com) or come and visit me at my residency at [SaTorre](https://www.instagram.com/satorrecaputxes/), minimal space of maximum creativity.
