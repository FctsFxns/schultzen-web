# The Artist Says

I’m an artist.  
I’m an artist because I give it all.

I’m a professional artist because my income is sustained by my projects.  
"I am an artist because that’s what I do best"  
I always explain what I do differently, depends on who is asking.   
  
My work is made for the one and for all.   
I aim to approximate the gap between you and me,   
between invention and intervention,   
between difficulties and playfulness.

Always digging for subversive ground and willing to keep on learning. More radical than I look like. Smile.  
Ask a lot. Listen.

I work with cinematic and performative elements, interviews, online calls, collages, talks, stop motion, audio and video.  
It depends on the project, the content and what in my means transports itself better to YOU.

If you'd like to know more, please don't hesitate to write me a card, a letter, a [mail](mailto:contact@christinaschultz.com).

Or come and see me at my residency at [Hangar](https://hangar.org/ca/residents/artistes-residents/), centre de producció artística en Barcelona.
