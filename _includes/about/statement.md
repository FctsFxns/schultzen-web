# The Artist Says

I am a transdisciplinary artist, oral performer and linguistic nomad. My preferred art forms are: *the voice*, *scenic interpretation* and *drawings*. I develop collaborative projects motivated by the love for people, their desires and their doubts. The constructions of my stories are based on the wholeness of error, the knowledge of the stigmatized and the beauty of clumsiness.
With long term collaborations I explore the possibilities of collectivity through *choir work*, *poetry* and *physical movement* as sources of community knowledge.

I am based in Barcelona since more then 20 years. If you'd like to know more, please don't hesitate to write me a card, a letter, a [mail](mailto:contact@christinaschultz.com) or come and visit me at my residency at [SaTorre](https://www.instagram.com/satorrecaputxes/), minimal space of maximum creativity.
