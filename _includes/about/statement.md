# The Artist Says

I’m an artist because I aim to live my live, following the artistic principle of expanding creativity.
  
I’m an artist because I give it all.
  
I am an artist because that’s what I love and therefore do best.

I am an artist because others share the same opinion. 
 
I always explain differently what I do. It depends on who is asking.   

I work with performance, video, voice and prints. I switch constantly between the digital and the analog world. I use cinematic and performative elements, interviews, online calls, collages, drawings, fotographs, talks, stop motion, audio and video.  
I am what you might call multidisciplinary and still with a recognizable handwriting.
  
My work is made for the one and for all.   
I aim to approximate the gap between you and me,   
between invention and intervention,   
between difficulties and playfulness.

Always digging for subversive ground and willing to keep on learning. More radical than I look like. Smile.  
Ask a lot. Listen.
