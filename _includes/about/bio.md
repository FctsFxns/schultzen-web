# About

Born on february the 5th, in Munich, Germany 1972. At this moment I am a long term resident for 2 years at hangar.org in Barcelona, Spain.

I am a so called autodidact, which means that I learned everything in collaborations with talented people, organizations and companies such as:
Daniel Canet, software engineer, Claudia Giralt Monedero, digital design student, Les Salonnières, art colective, Clara Garí, curator at “Nau Côclea”, Editorial Gustavo Gili, Loring Art Library and everybody who took part in my actions.

This was made possible by Hangar, centre de producció artística, Clara Garí, Nau Côclea and Oscar Abril Ascaso, the workshops of “Nau Estruch”, the events of “Liminal GR”, Fundació Tàpies, Festival de Poble Nou, Paola Marugán, “Jugar a tres bandas “, Galería Fidel Balaguer, AAVC workshops and Espacio Práctico.
