This investigation is a collaborative and international research about personal intimacy and safe spaces with women in prison.  It started out with several poetry writing workshops during since 2023 at the female Penitentiary Center Wad Ras in Barcelona and turned into an ongoing letter-writing process that aims to build bridges between people's ideas and concepts about personal intimacy and feeling safe. The project works from inside out, writing letters from the perspectives of intimacy of a Penitentiary environment (the bed, the window, the sheet, the shower) which are given to other people in different contexts. The first was Clean Break, a Theatre project for women with prison experience in London and extended to neighbourhood associations and Civic Centres in Barcelona. People answer these letters from their own personal intimacy ideas (music, reading, walks, water) and a cross over dialog happens connecting and disconnecting people, objects, spaces and activities.

As we build up a corpse of literary intimacy spaces the participants were portrayed during the act of writing as sort of an homage to representing women pursuing intellectual activities. These portraits now form part of a transitable installation that aims to build an ephemeral and vague space of intimacy - as vague and diffuse as our ideas and concepts of personal safe spaces.

The project awaits to present the whole of its outcomes in 2027 at the Felicia Fuster Foundation and will be presented at many different venues during 2025 and 2026: 3 Civic Centres, Baró de Viver, Can Basté and Navas in Barcelona and the Biennale of Andorra. There are more collaboration still to confirm.
