A walking tour for four groups to meet on the 1st of july 2020 at the Art space Espai Nyamnyam in Mieres. The participating art centers, Nau Côclea, Festival Ü del Bac, the Cultural Rizoma cooperative and the Nyamnyam collective walk with the artists they usually work with.

Walkers from Nau Côclea to Mieres: Clara Garí, Christina Schultz, Imma Pla, Mark Aitken

The idea is to reach the meeting point by foot and thus increase our availability, our attention, our creativity and concentration to find among all new ways of networking and relationships between our cultural projects and the natural backgrounds of the places where we are settled.
