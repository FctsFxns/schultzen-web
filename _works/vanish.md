This is a performance, a lecture, a physical contemplation on the difference between work and labour, the productive and the consumable. Texts are read in the hammock while unproductive gestures accompany the lecture. 

The Performance is a colaboration with different artist invited personally, who somehow relate to doing nothing. So far have been participating Valeria Linera, a sculptorer and yoga teacher and Juan David Gallindo, artist and performer.
