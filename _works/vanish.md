I still don’t now what doing nothing is, but I do know what it not is. Therefore it is a negation.
This project will penetrate and trascendend one aspect of doing nothing. It will enter in the Kingdom of Boredom. We only get bored when we are forced to it and anyway try to end this state as soon as possible. With the colaboration of others I will explore what’s behind boredom. What comes next.

This is a project in it’s inicial phase and soon we will release the Call for the performatic colaboration.
A first part will be exhibited the 17th and 18th of september during TOP 2016 at Hangar.org. My studio will be open for visits and I will be glad to receive you. So far you can watch this video I made for the ocasion.
