This workshop/laboratory, in colaboration with Daniel Canet, software engineer, was held during three practice and theory based sessions at [Hangar](https://hangar.org/es/programa-hangar/formacio/taller-piratas-profetes-i-parasitoides-configura-la-teva-digital/) and presented it's experiments during the fourth date in form of a performative internet flea market, inspired by the concept of [Yami-Ichi](http://yami-ichi.biz/) at Sala Ricson, Hangar. We were also proud to hace Violeta Mayoral as a special guest to talk about her [no-face project](https://www.instagram.com/thenoface_project/).

As a result of the three sessions the participating group presented their digital life hacks brought to physical existence, prints, performances and games, mixed with 'pongos', a spanish word for useless objects you don't dare to throw away. Everything was on sale.
During the event, a huge ham was to be conquered by posting a picture with it on Instagram and the group elaborated a fanzine of 40 pages reflecting the experiments and thoughts inspired by the workshop. You can consult it online on [Hangar's site for publications](https://hangar.org/es/category/publicacions/)

The workshop was comunicated through mostly private social media platforms and by analog posters on the streets of Barcelona.
