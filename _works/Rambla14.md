This performance simulates a journey through time, starting in the year 1973 passing through the present and arriving in the near future, 2072, where glimpses of the daily life of some neighbours (fictional and real) who inhabit the building on Rambla 14 can be captured. 

Starting in front of the building at the [Art Centre Santa Monica](https://artssantamonica.gencat.cat/ca/detall/Rambla-14-fragments-itinerants-en-tres-temps) the audience is guided across the Rambla by two neighbours sharing daily life episodes. After entering the building the audience keeps moving up the stairs to discover seven fictional situations at each floor. 

The itinerant performance was made possible thanks to the support of the Santa Monica art centre and especially the collaboration of the neighbourhood association SOS Ramblas. 
During their ongoing activist work to save the Rambla from a detonating gentrification process, they detected a building that is currently half empty and shared in property between the Catalan Government, the Generalitat, and four private owners. 
The dramatic writings designed for that specific building were conceived by a small group of people, invited to investigate transversal writing. During three months we gathered each Tuesday and wrote dialogs occupying and inhabiting the building with literary characters based on reality. I recommend to check out the complex project [Fer Forats or Making Holes](https://www.christinaschultz.com/works/HacerAgujeros/).

The characters were inspired by real people from the present yet also freely interpreted based on 400 love letters from 1973 between a former neighbour of the building next door to Rambla 14 and her fiancé stationed in the Spanish Sahara. 

The authors: Christina Schultz, Carlos Clemente, Diego Ballestrini, Mar Merino, Ricardo Cardenas and Aida Gonzalez
Facilitators and participants: Eduard Elias, Ana Moreno and Pep, former and actual neighbours of the Ramblas and Angela, Fernando and Nadia, who sporadically joined the writing sessions (thank you!). 
The actors: Carol Muakuku, Cinta Moreno, David Anguera, Gemma Charines and Lisa Reventós.

Last but not least a *heterotopic* publication was confectionized by and for the Santa Monica Art Centre: six white curtains, printed on them five 10-line-dialogs between the fictional characters of the piece. The curtains are meant to allow to divide the meeting place as needed by the new residents of the Art Centre. Again I recommend to check out the project [Fer Forats or Making Holes](https://www.christinaschultz.com/works/HacerAgujeros/).

Here are images of the two performances shown in july 2022 extracted from a recording by Carlos Clemente and myself.
