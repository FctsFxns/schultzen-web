This performance simulates a journey through time, starting in the year 1973 passing through the present and arriving in the near future, 2072, where glimpses of the daily life of some neighbours (fictional and real) who inhabit the building on Rambla 14 can be captured. 

Starting in front of the building at the art centre Santa Monica the audience is guided across the Rambla by two neighbours sharing daily life episodes. After entering the building the audience keeps moving up the stairs to discover seven fictional situations at each floor. 

The semi-fictional piece was made possible thanks to the support of the [art centre Santa Monica](https://artssantamonica.gencat.cat/ca/detall/Rambla-14-fragments-itinerants-en-tres-temps)and especially the collaboration of the neighbourhood association SOS Ramblas. During their ongoing activist work to save the Rambla from a detonating gentrification process, they  detected a building that is currently half empty and shared in property between the Catalan Government, the Generalitat, and four private owners. A small group of people, invited by Christina Schultz, gathered each Tuesday during a couple of months and wrote dialogs occupying and inhabiting the building with literary characters based on reality. You can watch more information on the entry of the project [Hacer Agujeros](https://www.christinaschultz.com/works/HacerAgujeros/)

The characters were inspired by real people from the present yet also freely interpreted based on a small treasure discovered by the group in March 2022: 400 love letters from 1973 between a former neighbour of the building next door to Rambla 14 and her fiancé stationed in the Spanish Sahara. 

The collective authorship between Christina Schultz, Carlos Clemente, Diego Ballestrini, Mar Merino, Ricardo Cardenas and Aida Gonzalez, some residents of the Ramblas and other people, who sporadically joined the writing sessions (thank you Angela, Ana, Eduard, Fernando and Pep) was interpreted by five theatre actors: Carol Muakuku, Cinta Moreno, David Anguera, Gemma Charines and Lisa Reventós.

Last but not least a *heterotopic* present was made to the Santa Monica art centre: six white confectionalized curtains with 10-line-dialogs between the fictional characters of the piece to freely divide the meeting place of the new residents of the Art Centre.
