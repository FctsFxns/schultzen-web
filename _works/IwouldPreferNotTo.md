I would prefer not to is a performance on distance. The main actors are the people picking up the ringing phone exposed in the exhibition room. A monolog conversation, a narration by phone starts and leaves each listener with a small piece of the story. The story is never complete but on th eother hand is it ever? The work was shown the 5th of may at Sala Usurpada a squatted exhibition place in Gacia, Barcelona:
Trece ______ para una alteración. The selected artists were asked to occupy the room during 30 minutes. The event was composed by Gerard Ballester and Helena Vinent. Amongst the participating artists: Lucía Egaña, Marc Vives, Isamit Morales, Ariadna Guiteras, Nenazas, José Begega, Alexander Arilla and Sergi Botella.
