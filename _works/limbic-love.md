“Limbic Love” was a multidisciplinary investigation on where does love come from for the exhibition “I don’t believe in you but I believe in Love” curated by Paola Marugán. 

It synthesized in a live video performatic talk, a site specific collage and a limited edition of an artistic comic on childhood memories.
