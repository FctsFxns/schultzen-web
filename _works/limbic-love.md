Limbic Love had many different outcomes.  
  
A performance with the same title "**Limbic Love**" is part 3 of a stop motion trilogy on gore subjects. The musical talk ilustrates with live stop motion the cerebral origins of love. The performance was streamed through chatroulette, an online one to one, flirting platform.   

A self published comicbook was released in a limited edition. "**One day at the studio**" is a talk of 3 female artists during a coffee break about traumatic childhood memories. 

The mural work "**Enlightning**", was a site specific collage for the exhibition of "[I don't believe in you but I believe in love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMX2NIgh4kQ)" at Galería Fidel Balaguer
