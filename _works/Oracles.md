The drawings were inspired by medeival imagery representing the three thematic oracles sourrounding: BDSM practices, Transgender transitions and drug use. The three kiosks enabled performative readings of the future:

The Trans Oracle answers questions concerning any kind of transitive moment through elements of gender transition processes: a testosterone blocker, an Estradiol hormon spray, a pain killer, a tape binder and a trickster.

The BDSM oracle answer through a flogger or a belt, candles, "mordaza", strings and a feather.

The Drug Tarot represents 37 archetypes sourrounding situations of drug use. From the spiritual and the high one to the hang over and the lost.

The three performative oracles were discussed and devised in collaboration with [Metzineres, shelter for women who use drugs and survive violences](http://metzineres.net/) a day care space for women who take drugs and survive multiple situations of violence as part of the project [Conjuros y Colocones](https://www.christinaschultz.com/works/metzineres/) or Spells and Potions. 

They were exposed in the frame of the program [Invocaciones part I and II](https://www.macba.cat/es/exposiciones-actividades/actividades/invocaciones-acto-i) at the MACBA, museum for contemporary art in Barcelona.

The Drug Tarot is now available in three languages.
