Be part of my art.  

Through an online platform, “You your Wall and Me” asked for a wall of any size, to elaborate personalized and transcendental collage works.

Semi-structured, individual interviews and the ancestral architectural methodology of "Feng Shui" interpreted the emerging energies of all participants
and depicted them into wall-sized collages to enhance the personal growth of each person.  

The final exhibition was realized through a bicycle tour, a blog, the web site and and a mobile application.

2 of the big collages were conserved and framed. 3 smaller pieces are conserved digitally and 2 were destroyed.

The whole project is represented [on this website](http://www.christinaschultz.com/wall/).

A [Facebook profile](https://www.facebook.com/youyourwallandme/) and [a blog](http://christina-schultz.tumblr.com/) comunicated the progressing process.
