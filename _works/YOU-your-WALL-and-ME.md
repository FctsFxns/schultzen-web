4 site specific collage pieces have influenced transcendentally the vital moments of 4 participants of this project.   
Be part of my art.  

Through an online platform, “You your Wall and Me” asked for a wall of any size, to elaborate personalized collages.

Semi-structured, individual interviews and the ancestral architectural methodology of "Feng Shui" interpreted the emerging energies 
and depicted them into wall-sized collages to enhance the personal growth of each person.  

The final exhibition was realized through a bicycle tour, a blog, the web site and and a mobile application.
