'The Drug Tarot' is another chapter of the long-term investigation of the project [Conjuros y Colocones](https://www.christinaschultz.com/works/metzineres/) or Spells and Potions in collaboration with [Metzineres, shelter for women who use drugs and survive violences](http://metzineres.net/) a day care space for women who take drugs and survive multiple situations of violence.
The Drug Tarot (now available in three languages) was released during a performative event devised in colaboration with the Metzineres Womxn exposing different thematic fortune telling games. The Tarot was conceived already as the base for fiction narratives on drugs for the [A-narco-mistical Her-Stories](https://www.christinaschultz.com/works/HistoriasAnarco-misticas/).
The other oracles included: a Trans Oracle, a BDSM oracle, a Lucky Charm Oracle, a Stone Oracle and a Make Up Oracle. All of these fortunetellings where devised in colaboration with participants of the Metzineres space and performed by their very authors.
The conceptual work on the oracles sets base to talk about hopes and desires of  the person asking and also raises a discussion about taboo topics, such as transgender and transsexuality, BDSM erotic practices, immigration and anything that can emerge between the teller and the questioner.
