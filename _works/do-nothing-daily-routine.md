The second part of an ongoing study on do nothing.
Do Nothing Two was a daily, simultaneous training together with Clara Garí of doing nothing.

This "do nothing” was not understood as a meditative state, nor a freeze-frame but a non - activity without purpose.   
Nor to produce nor to relax. Just let it do.  
 
Each daily experience was then afterward registered in a blog.
