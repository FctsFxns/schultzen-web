Do nothing II is the second part of an ongoing study on doing nothing as an artistic, subversive practice.
This project was a daily training of purposeless doing, simultaneously with Clara Garí, head of the artist residency Nau Côclea at Empordá, Catalunya.

Doing nothing was not a meditative state, nor a freeze-frame but a non - activity without purpose during one hour every day for 30 days.      
Nor to produce nor to relax. Just let it do.

Each daily experience was then afterward registered in a blog.

The piece was first exhibited in november 2015 at Pogom, Zagreb during the group exhibition "Long Live Labour" curated by Leila Topic.

Other participating artist were Zeljko Badurina, Sinisa Labrovic, Vlado Martek, Antonio Paucar, Julien Prévieux, Oliver Ressler, Christina Schultz, Mladen Stilinovic, Péter Szabó, David Thorne, Marko Vojnic Gin, Damir Zizic/ Kristian Kozul, Fokus group + design by Rafaela Drazic
