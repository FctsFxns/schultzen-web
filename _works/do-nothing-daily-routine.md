This "do nothing” was not understood as a meditative state, nor a freeze-frame but a non - activity without purpose.   
Nor to produce nor to relax. Just let it do.  

Do Nothing Two was a daily training during a month on what occurs if you do nothing.
Simultaneously with Clara Gari, an art curator, we did nothing during the  established time range between 15h to 16h.  
 
Each daily experience was then afterward registered in a blog.
