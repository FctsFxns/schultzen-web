'Anarco-mistical Herstories' (Historias Anarco-misticas) is a performative phantastical lecture in collaboration with [Metzineres, shelter for women who use drugs and survive violences](http://metzineres.net/) a day care space for women who take drugs and forms part of the investigation project 'Conjuros y Colocones' or 'Spells and Potions' in English.

The texts were written between Aida, Chiara, Coral, Itzaskun, Laia, Marcela, Sara and Christina Schultz, based on a colectively created deck of archetypical Tarot cards, the Drug Tarot.
The dramaturgic stage elements, costumes and sound were also created and inspired by Conchi, Fia, Maria, Paola, Clara, and many other users of the Metzineres space.

Apart from myself, the performers of the piece and co-authors of the script are [Lisa Revent√≥s](http://www.actorsmartatort.com/project/lisa-reventos/), actress and educator, [Sonia G. Vilar](https://cuaj.org/), artist and cook.
We received very special support by the artist residency of [Escoles Velles in Palautordera](https://tauladecultura.cat/en-residencia/residencia-de-christina-schultz-conjuros-y-colocones/) for the conceptualization of the piece.
