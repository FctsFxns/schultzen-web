'Anarco-mistical Hersories' (Historias Anarco-misticas)is a performative recitative in collaboration with [Metzineres, shelter for women who use drugs and survive violences](http://metzineres.net/) a day care space for women who take drugs and forms part of the ongoing investigation on 'Metzineres, women between poisons and remedies'.

So far, we shared the piece in three open rehearsals. You can watch it [HERE](https://vimeo.com/662552033) but will need to ask for the password. Please write to contact@christinaschultz.com

The texts were written by Aida, Chiara, Coral, Itzaskun, Laia, Marcela, Sara and Christina Schultz, based on a self created deck of Tarot cards, the Drug Tarot.
Other details of the piece, such as dramaturgic elements, costumes and other elements were also created and inspired by Conchi, Fia, Maria, Paola, Clara, and many other users of the Metzineres space.
