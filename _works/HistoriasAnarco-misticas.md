'Anarco-mistical Hersories' (Historias Anarco-misticas) is a performative phantasy lecture in collaboration with [Metzineres, shelter for women who use drugs and survive violences](http://metzineres.net/) a day care space for women who take drugs and forms part of the investigation project *'Conjuros y Colocones' or 'Spells and Potions' in English.

The texts were written by Aida, Chiara, Coral, Itzaskun, Laia, Marcela, Sara and Christina Schultz, based on a colectively created deck of archetypical Tarot cards, the Drug Tarot.
The dramaturgic stage elements, costumes and sound were also created and inspired by Conchi, Fia, Maria, Paola, Clara, and many other users of the Metzineres space.

Apart from myself, the performers of the piece and co-authors of the script are [Lisa Revent√≥s](http://www.actorsmartatort.com/project/lisa-reventos/), interpret and educator, [Sonia G. Vilar](https://cuaj.org/), artist and cook.
We received very special support by the artist residency of [Escoles Velles in Palautordera](https://tauladecultura.cat/en-residencia/residencia-de-christina-schultz-conjuros-y-colocones/) for the conceptualization of the piece.

The performance was presented as dress rehearsals:

10th of december 2021 at MACBA, museum of contemporary art in Barcelona
17th of december 2021 at Nau Ivanow and
19th of december 2021 at Espai Fosc, Sant Esteve de Palautordera

The script of the piece will soon be available as a downloadable pdf under the rights of open source creative commons. We would be happy if you want to use it.
