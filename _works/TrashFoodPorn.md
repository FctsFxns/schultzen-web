This playful reflection on what food really means to us, was produced as a performtic talk for Liminal GR, curated by Pilar Cruz and Marc Roig.   
The outcomes were:   

* A performatic talk. 
* Crumbs, an animated video-foodlooper with pleasure tips.   
* Ephimeral sculptures of pornografic food instalations.
