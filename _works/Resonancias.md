From the proper experience of very diverse group of 14 people, during four months in weekly meetings, we made experiments with collective narratives, not only verbal but also generated by the body and by movement, sharing our taboos, shames, conformities and disagreements with sexuality in our societies by giving them physical places. The result of this collaborative work was shown in two presentations in the center of dance and movement, the Graner and in the auditorium of the MACBA, contemporary art museum of Barcelona in a performance: an album of seven choreographies, who speak of our intimate experiences in homosexuality, nonconformity with gender, feelings of emptiness, loneliness and abuse and the shelter found in touch and body.

The Homesession art center will show the entire project and its outcomes in an audiovisual and installation exhibition during expectedly 15th to the 19th of november.

The show is a compilation of an audiovisual of the performance, portraits and drawings, a textile installation and a documentary of the process.
At this time you can check the program and the credits of the project on its website [Resonancias ](http://resonancias.christinaschultz.com/)
