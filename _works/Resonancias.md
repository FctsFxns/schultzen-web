This project has a [proper website](http://resonancias.christinaschultz.com/) where you can enjoy it's process, works and outcomes.

Here's a short summary:
From the proper experience of very diverse group of 16 people, during four months in weekly meetings, we made experiments with collective narratives, not only verbal but also generated by the body and by movement, sharing our taboos, shames, conformities and disagreements with sexuality in our societies by giving them physical places. 

The result of this collaborative work was shown in two presentations in the center of dance and movement, the Graner and in the auditorium of the MACBA, contemporary art museum of Barcelona in a performance: an album of seven choreographies, who speak of our intimate experiences in homosexuality, nonconformity with gender, feelings of emptiness, loneliness and abuse and the shelter found in touch and body.

The Homesession art center hosted a solo show of the project and its outcomes in an audiovisual and installation exhibition during the month of november 2019.

The exhibition was composed by a holographic visual, a foto-portrait-instalation, drawings, a textile installation and a documentary of the process.

The performance 'Cuerpo de Resonancias' was made in colaboration with many marvelous people.

This project was made possible by the support of:

* [Homesession.org](https://homesession.org)
