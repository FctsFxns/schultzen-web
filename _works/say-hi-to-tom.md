Say hi to Tom! is a project between the digital and the analog comunication world. A online call invited people to write an analog postcard to the artist and answer three questions. The postcards would be modified corresponding to the answers and turned into digital prints.
 
An interactive game to re-vindicate written 
communication, a joke on massive tourism and a turnaround of distributing artistic work. The project was entirely fostered by an auction house in Barcelona and was auctioned in February 2014.

You can still visit [the catalog](/media/pdf/1423861538-CATALOGO-SUBARNA.pdf), and also [the online platform](http://www.christinaschultz.com/postcards/) of the project.   

A selected collage by the audience was projected in huge format on an open wall in Barcelona. Each participant received a collage via postal mail.
