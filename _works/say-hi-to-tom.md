is a parodic response to all the countries that are about to turn into "Souvenirlandia" invading public space with a multicultural population on vacation.  

A crowdsourced action, an invitation to participate in an online call for analog postcards.  
An interactive game to re-vindicate written 
communication, a joke on massive tourism and a turnaround of distributing artistic work.

A website with an open call was published and in 2 months, 36 postcards were received and turned into personalized collages.  

A selected collage by the audience was projected in huge format on an open wall in Barcelona. Another printed in a limited edition, signed and sent to all the participants via postal mail.  

3 editions of the series of 36 collage works were auctioned at a true Auction house in Barcelona.
