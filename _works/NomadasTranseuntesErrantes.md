**Nomads, transients and wanderers, an odyssey in objects** was launched for the first time at the [International AIDS congres in Munich](https://www.iasociety.org/conferences/aids2024/programme/global-village). It was presented by Aura Roig, Silvie Ojeda and myself at a [Stattpark Olga](https://olga089.de/2024/07/20/eine-odysee-in-objekten-mittwoch-24-7-trash-test-donnerstag-25-7/), an alternative cultural melting spot and place to shelter trucks for living.

The suitcase was build and presented with the support of many people. [Lars Petrova Taylor](https://www.maker-community.org/) gets a special mentioning for the exellent and perfectly fitting woodwork.

At a time when travelling has become a banality and even a burden, the participants of [Metzineres, shelter for women who use drugs and survive violences](http://metzineres.net/)still want to rethink ourselves as nomads, transients and wanderers. Because life itself is an odyssey for us.

We revived the origin of the word Odyssey (·ΩàŒ¥œçœÉœÉŒµŒπŒ±) and designed a cabinet of curiosities: a suitcase of significant objects for the Metzineres. Between debates and a lot of laughter, the following essential concepts emerged that make life a journey, and the journey an odyssey: farewell, wandering, hospitality, the omen, the test and the challenge, return, the magic potion and the seven world wonders.

Farewells hurt us. We believe that wandering and aimlessness are undervalued and that hospitality is crucial. The difference between a test and a challenge is that one questions what you know and the other what you do not. The omen is a shattering sign that does not distinguish between right and wrong. The return is a return to ourselves, to our self-determination. The magic potion fills us with properties we need in concrete situations. The seven world wonders are at least seven times seven. We are not the first to change the list, but we are the most radical in adapting it to our idea of phenomena.
