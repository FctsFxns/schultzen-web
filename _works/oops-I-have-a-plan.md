“Lightning Studies - Centre for the Translation of Constraints, Conflicts and Contaminations” curated by Renan Laru-an for the Encura Grant by Hangar.org and Curator’s Network concentrates on discursive architecture generated from horizontal scenes of knowledge.  

The HANGAR resident artists that have been selected for this curatorial experience by Renan Laru-an, Lightning Studies: CTCCCs are Megan Michalak, the artists duo Giuliana Racco/Matteo Guidi, Mario Santamaría y Christina Schultz.

My contribution is a poetic discurse on post - colonialism, institution and institutionalization through the confrontation of 2 popular tools: The Cover and the Remix.

The outcome was a video-collage of scenes from castaways throughout movie history and a live Remix version of "oops, oh my" by Tweet, produced by Timberland
