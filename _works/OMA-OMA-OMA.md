This animated documentary portrays Hildegard Schultz, my grandmother.

During 20 minutes we will get to know the opinions, experiences and the current life of a 96 year old, german lady.

She talks about sex, men and being old in a residence-home. Her wasted body is replaced by an animated paper body and the collage environments transport her into a familiar and warm atmosphere. She is straight out, funny, sometimes clueless - but always alive and present.
