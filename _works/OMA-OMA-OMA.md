My grandmother died at the age of 97 in an elderly residency.During her last months of her life, we did numerous interviews, photos, video and super8 films.The result is an absurd and historic documentation of her past and actual living situation, a review of points of view on gender issues of a gone generation, a funny but sad collage movie mix.
A mixture of analog shadow - animation technique, After Effects and video editing. The splendid music made by [Parasyte Woman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukMsPZ4-I6U) emphasizes the collage caracter of this project.
