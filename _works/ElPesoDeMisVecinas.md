It focuses on the lives of female ’Contrabandistas’, the so called Porteadoras at the Melilla border and a group of female moroccan immigrants in my neighbourhood in Barcelona.
The methods to investigate about their weightfull circumstances is through living with them and composing songs while cooking, cleaning or during loose reunions at home.
Composing songs that narrate about intimate lives is a tradition formerly relegated especially to Amazigh women of Northern Morocco and executed mainly in familiar contexts but also at weddings or other festive acts.

The projects does not pretend to be a reliable anthropological research but a chaotic collection of string narratives that do not distinguish between fabulation and report.
Close ups in photography of faces were mainly avoided but a continuous practice of live drawings reflect portraits and gazes that were only possible in intimacy.

The following pictures reflect a 6 weeks visit and coexistence in Nador in the house of newly known women who earn their living with “trabando”. Trabando is a combination of two Spanish words, trabajo (work) and contrabando (smuggle) and indicates the a-legal activity of transporting goods from Melilla to Nador with their bodies.

This project is supported with a grant by Barcelona Producció 2017/2018 and the vital support of Jiwar, Le18 and Nau Côclea, all three are artist residencies in Barcelona, Marrakech and Camallera.

One of these women is the Porteadora with whom i spent a couple of days. The other is her landlord of a minuscule room without windows and the third is a neighbor with a golden teeth and a crooked smile. The following portrait is hers.

In October the border was closed on Friday, Saturday and Sunday for the 'atipical traffic'. Since I left it is only open two days a week. Nadias, Fatimas and Luizas despair is lived cooking, singing and talking about not much.

This is how a Moroccan wedding looks from the backside. The garage is the kitchen and the kitchen where men will eat as invisible as possible. Stti and Fatima are between 60 and 80, neither of them knows her exact age, and manage the 28 shared plates going out for the guests. Fatima is the groom's grandmother and Stti the neighbor. It's a all women run heavy work which needs a lot of collaboration from neighbor to neighbor.

Nadia, contrabandista, she doesn't like the word porteadora, gets up at 2h30 in the morning to wait sometimes 5 hours in the cue at the Melilla border until the door opens. When she comes back for lunch with a big smile on her face for her three small children and also for me, she has already spent about 14 hours awake.

The day I waited outside of the door of the "barrio chino" for Nadia to come out, I spend 6 hours together with Syrian refugees who waited anxiously for the gate to open and maybe take a chance to blend in with all the people, who once orderly in a cue, stream out like overfloating water, rolling or carrying their huge "bultos" as fast as possible. I wouldn't imagine at that point that I would see them all again the last day I decided to spend in a hotel instead of staying at Luiza's. Here is Samira having a break from her multiple brothers, sisters and cousins and their fathers waiting here in Nador to follow their mothers who managed to slip through the Moroccan guards mostly disguised as "Porteadoras". Morocco won't let them pass to seek help at the CRG, the center for war refugees.

Both of the travels were made by boat, minimum 25 timeless hours floating slowly and solemnly through a worldly waters, whose only frontiers were different telephone companies. The visit ended with the same women sharing the cabin with me who during my stay in Nador also shared her life with me.

As I said in the beginning, this is a multiple storietelling with many things to talk anf think about. I guess video art piece would be adequat to collage all the freshly cooked material. Enshallah.
