The performance "Aixopluc" (shelter in catalan) is part of the ongoing project INSIDE OUT, which investigates the meaning of domestic and solitary intimacy spaces for women in a situation of confinement through performative writing.

The physical poem reflects on water as an empowering element for the imprisoned women, as a bridge to our profound not-knowing about their situation, referencing the Nereids, the daughters of the god of the seas in Greek mythology. Although they are direct descendants of an important god in mythology writings, they were never given much attention other than insisting on their extreme beauty. So close yet so far away, just like women in the penalty system.

The piece was presented the 16th of august as an invitation of the [Grand Tour 2023](https://elgrandtour.net/en/) by Nau Côclea and Clara Garí
