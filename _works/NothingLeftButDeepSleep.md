This work was conceived through a online residency project TRAVERSE, a collaboration between Hangar.org, center for art production and research, Barcelona and Billede Kunst Center, Aarhus together with the Danish artist Anders Visti. 

The idea of the project was to question the role of the contemporary artist as a cultural producer bond to capitalist economy rather then to filosophic freedom and responsibility. Each of us decided to create independent but colaborative works that would reflect and answer to a general exhaustion in the working society we percieved during our regular discussions. Both of us decided to create a service:

Anders work 'Your Work Was Never About You' is an online meditation leaned on 'Mindfullness' where I colaborated with my voice.

'Nothing Left But Deep Sleep' gathers traditional lullabies with new verses reflecting on 'the exhausted producer' in two different, poetic ways. 'Sleep like a Rock' and 'Nothing left but Deep Sleep'. The songs can be heard dialing the spanish landline + 34 93 595 12 65 or be downloaded as a score in pdf. The score was written by Anders Visti.
The work was installed in a performatic talk with the newspaper ad, showing the number and a telephone to call. Also there are two digital collages that were never published.
