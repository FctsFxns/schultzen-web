'Charms and Potions, female cures by metzineres' is a project in collaboration with [Metzineres, shelter for women who use drugs and survive violences](http://metzineres.net/) a day care space for women who take drugs.
This ongoing artistic project is recovering and inventing female knowledge on poetic cures through conspiring spells, charms, potions, rituals and magic objects to attract love, money, health and specific personal needs that hope to be fullfilled. During weekly workshops we create rimes and poems, herbal essences and conjured brooms, ritual masks and gestures to pronounce and achieve our desires. In a future not far away they will be published in different fanzine formats, drawings, rituals and private performances.

Soon we will inform you on further steps of the process.

This project counts with the support of the research grant by the catalan government issued in 2020. (OSIC)
