The object of main interest of this project is the blanket, main object imported by the so called Porteadoras at the Melilla border. The imported industrial syntetic blankets, seen in every moroccan houshold are compared with the traditionally moroccan, handwoven ones bought by tourists. With a scetchbook and a sound recorder I made contact with carpet sellers, ironers, housewifes, travelers and merchants to observe their activity through my drawings and asked many questions about their desires towards these objects. 

The work was presented in a radio-performance, reading through my scetchbook sonorized with the field audio recordings, a wrapped box a sell-buy experiment I held upon myself. I smuggeled a very soft blanket blanket from Melilla to Marrakech taking the same route as the contrabandistas and sold it to a moroccan women in Marrakech for than to buy a handwoven blanket for the same price. All interactions during the experiment woke up many desires in my body which finally helped to understand a little more on Objects And Desires.

This project was supported by a grant from Institut Ramón LLull, and two artist residencies in Barcelona and Marrakech Jiwar, creació i societat and Le18.
