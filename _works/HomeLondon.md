The London theatre scene is THE best at the time and I want to be in it.Thatâ€™s why I decided to pack my three bags and stay, study and write in the epicentre of drama writing for a period of approx. three to six months, starting at the beginning of October.

So, I am looking for a quiet, peaceful and warm home.

My financial income is tailored to my dedication to fine arts and Spanish living cost level and not yet at the hight of London living costs.
Yet,  I have a lot of talents to offer in exchange for a decent place to live, write and keep up giving my online German lessons.

Have you ever thought about bringing out your creative and relational traits working with an artist who would customise a personalised creativity training for you? From making design decisions for your house to taking classes in creative writing, drawing, collage and other visual techniques, I can offer to help you dive deep into your own fountain of creativity and love.
Maybe you are more in need of intellectual stimulation? Reading and discussing books (or let them read to you), philosophy classes or art history? 
As well as in my art practice as in my extended experinece in tutoring german conversation I trained myself to be a great learning partner.

But also maybe you could actually use somewhat more practical support, such as archiving family memories or libraries, companionship for your pets, attention for an elderly person or practicing one of the following languages: German, Spanish or Catalan.

I do not only have broad but also documented experience on all of these skills through teaching practice and midlife career in contemporary Arts in Barcelona. 

Does that inspire you or maybe given an idea what you always wanted to get done but it was just never the right moment?
I am sure we could find just the right mixture for you.

What I need in exchange is a quiet, peaceful room to sleep, write and work with internet connection, access to a kitchen to cook my vegetarian food. Of course I will keep those places clean and respect your daily use.

Please do see through the works I elaborated during the last ideas to get an idea of what my work looks like and read testimonials on my listening qualities on [ITALKI](http://www.italki.com/teacher/7545276/german). 
Please get in touch with me throgh mail, telefone or write me a letter.
