The London theatre scene is THE best at the time and I want to be in it. That's why I decided to pack my three bags and stay, study and write in the epicentre of drama writing for a period of approx. three to six months, starting at the beginning of October.

Hello! I am looking for a quiet, peaceful and warm home.

My financial income is tailored to my dedication to the fine arts and Barcelona living costs and not yet at the height of London standards.
Yet, I have a lot of talents to offer in exchange for a decent place to live, write and keep up offering my online, matinal German classes.

If your interests and expertise is in crafts and or creative thinking processes I can offer mine to support yours. My artistic work is relational and I can give much support in dynamization of groups and workshops but also train in amplifying people skills. I have applied experiences in using Feng Shui to make spacial decisions, not only as a decoration tool but also as part of a learning process. I can also back up creative drama writing, documentary drawing, collage making and other printable techniques. I control setting up fotoshootings or videodocumentation and the post production process with photoshop. I am no specialist in pottery or gardening but I love getting my hands dirty and I am a good learner.
I am not very good with sewing. Unfortunately.

One of my mayor interests lie in artistic research. I can help in any kind of artistic investigation, from archiving, reading and resuming books and papers to field methodologies such as contacting with people, making formal interviews or engage someone in a conversation. I am a good listener because I enjoy it.  
I have been applying this skill with much success tutoring advanced, second language German speakers yet also in working in the documentary field and in my relational artistic practice.

Maybe you are in need of somewhat more practical and intimate support? Such as in archiving family memories or libraries, a video documentation of your work or a content update of your website. I also love caregiving activities such as companionship for your pets, attention for an elderly person or broadening your communication knowledge of one of the following languages: German, Spanish or Catalan.

I do not only have extensive but also documented experience on all of these skills, acquired through years of my own art practice within a midlife career in contemporary Arts in Barcelona and over 700 hours of tutoring. 

Does my profile resonate with you but what you need is not on the list?
Let's talk!
I am sure together we can find out what would fit best for your life situation.

What I need in exchange is a quiet, peaceful room to sleep, write and work. I will bring my work with me, giving online German classes, and will need the timeslot and the internet connection to sustain myself. I will also ask for access to a kitchen to cook my vegetarian food. Of course I will respect your daily routines and adjust to them easily.

Please do see through the works I elaborated during the last years to get an idea of what my artistic quest looks like and read testimonials on my tutoring qualities on [ITALKI](http://www.italki.com/teacher/7545276/german). 

Please get in touch with me through mail or ask for my number to talk on the phone or my address to write me a letter.
I would love to hear from you.
