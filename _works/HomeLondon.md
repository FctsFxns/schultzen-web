The London theatre scene is THE best at the time and I want to be in it. Thatâ€™s why I decided to pack my three bags and stay, study and write in the epicentre of drama writing for a period of approx. three to six months, starting at the beginning of October.

So, I am looking for a quiet, peaceful and warm home.

My financial income is tailored to my dedication to the fine arts and Barcelona living costs and not yet at the height of London standards.
Yet,  I have a lot of talents to offer in exchange for a decent place to live, write and keep up giving my online German lessons.

Have you ever thought about bringing out your creative and relational traits working with an artist who would customise a personalised creativity training for you? From making design decisions for your house to taking classes in creative writing, drawing, collage and other visual techniques, I can offer to help you dive deep into your own fountain of creativity and love.
Maybe you are more in need of intellectual stimulation? Reading and discussing books (or let them read to you), philosophy classes or art history? 
As well as in my art practice as in my extended experience in tutoring advanced German conversation I trained myself to be a great listening and interlocutory partner.

Or could you actually use somewhat more practical support? Such as in archiving family memories or libraries, companionship for your pets, attention for an elderly person or broadening your knowledge of one of the following languages: German, Spanish or Catalan.

I do not only have extensive but also documented experience on all of these skills, acquired through years of tutoring practice and a midlife career in contemporary Arts in Barcelona. 

Do these skills resonate with you or have maybe raised the desire to perceive a new goal and now is just the right moment?
I am sure together we can find out what would fit best for your life situation.

What I need in exchange is a quiet, peaceful room to sleep, write and work with internet connection and access to a kitchen to cook my vegetarian food. Of course I will respect your daily routines and adjust to them easily.

Please do see through the works I elaborated during the last years to get an idea of what my artistic quest looks like and read testimonials on my tutoring qualities on [ITALKI](http://www.italki.com/teacher/7545276/german). 

Please get in touch with me through mail or ask for my number to talk on the phone or my address to write me a letter.
I would love to hear from you.
