EL FER i no fer (The doing and the not doing in catalan language) is a research project in performative, documentary technique style.

A puzzle of reflections on the phenomenon of time, labor and a society addicted to production.  

The framework of the project consists in a website with [5 chapters of a polyphonic audio collage](http://www.christinaschultz.com/FERnofer/El-Fer-Nr1-ElConceptoDeTrabajo), a printed score, transcription of the sound collage in a limited edition, a 3D QRcode, 5 videos of empty work spaces and [a blog](http://elfernofer.tumblr.com/) that documented a daily performative activity during 3 weeks.   
  
The “do nothing with others”.  

**El FER:** 

5 polyphonic audiocollages, made of interviews with people related to the art world, sound, music and historical documents, remix personal work experiences, wisdom, interpretations of the professional world and all the trouble on the so called activity WORK.

[This is the project's website!](http://www.christinaschultz.com/FERnofer/)  
 
**El no fer:** 

A white room, a carpet, some plants and a sofa. A one-to-one experience of doing nothing together with the artist. What does it mean to you and what can we not do?
It certainly is a denial.

**The Videos**

The 5 participants empty work spaces were filmed during a time they were not there. A healing registration of what is there when they are not.
