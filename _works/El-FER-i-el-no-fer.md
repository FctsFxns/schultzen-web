EL FER i no fer (The doing and the not doing in catalan language) is a research project in documentary technique style.

A puzzle of reflections on the phenomenon of time, labor and a society addicted to production.  

The framework of the project consists in a website with 5 chapters of a polyphonic audio collage, a printed score, transcription of the  sound collage in a limited edition, a fetish 3D object and a blog that documents a daily performative activity during 3 weeks.   
  
The “do nothing with others”.  

**El FER:** 

5 work spaces and 5 polifonic audiocollages made of interviews with people related to the art worls tell us about their work experience, the professional world and anything what means for them the so called activity WORK.  
 
**El no fer:** 

A white room, a carpet, some plants and a sofa. A one to one experience of doing nothing together with the artist. What does it mean to you and what can we not do?
