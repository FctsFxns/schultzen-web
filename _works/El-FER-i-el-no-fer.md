EL FER i no fer (The doing and the not doing in catalan language) is a research project in performative, documentary technique style.

A puzzle of reflections on the phenomenon of time, labor and a society addicted to production.  

El Fer no fer is a complex project made of visual art work, daily performances a teenage work group and a audiocollagebook in 5 chapters. 

Many people were involved and participated in the collaborative performances of doing nothing or gave their statements on work for the audiocollage. 

An exhibition at Casa Elizalde gathered all these different elements in a solo show in november 2015.

The project persists through a proper [website](http://www.christinaschultz.com/FERnofer/) to download the audiobook and [a blog named Fernofer](http://elfernofer.tumblr.com/), which collected the performatic experience. 

In this room every day people gathered with me to do participate at the performance of doing nothing. Here are 20 teenagers.

The other dark room contained a tower of 5 different almost still videos and the 5 QR cubes with inner light. The code leads you to the online audio files.

The space that linkes the dark and the light room together 
carried fotographs untidily pinned to the wall, as the ON VACATION posters they show.
