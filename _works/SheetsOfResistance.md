Sheets of resistance was conceived in the framework of Murals of Transition an ongoing investigation project on the Spanish Transition between 1976 to 1985. In this second edition I was invited to idea a project with people recommended by Social Services of the Grácia neighbourhood in Barcelona. A group of 7-10 people showed up consistently during 4 months to create a sense of belonging towards the memory of the neighbourhood. We dedicated the research specifically to the women in resistance during the Spanish transition and ourselves.
As a result we wrote a small script, imagining relations and conversations before an act of resistance in 1985, build a small architectonic model of a public place in Grácia, where all of us could live and finally we are recreating a mural with a message from 1986 that still resonates with us.
