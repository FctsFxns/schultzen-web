  <h1 class="title text-center">The Artist Says</h1>
  <p>"I’m an artist.".
  <br/>
  I’m an artist because I give it all.
  </p>

  <p>I’m a professional artist because my income is sustained by my projects.

  <br/>"I am an artist because that’s what I do best" </p>

  <p>I always respond differently, depends on who is asking. My work is made for the one and for all. I aim to approximate the gap between you and me, between invention and intervention, between difficulties and playfulness.
  <br/>Always digging for subversive ground and willing to keep on learning. More radical than I look like. Smile.
  <br/>Ask a lot. Listen. </p>
  <p >I work with cinematic and performative elements, interviews, online calls, collages, talks, stop motion, audio and video.
  <br/>It depends on the project, the content and what in my means transports itself better to YOU.</p>

  <p>If you'd like to know more, please don't hesitate to write me a card, a letter, a <a href="mailto:contact@christinaschultz.com">mail</a>.
  <br/>Or come and see me at my residency at <a href="http://hangar.org" title="Hangar, Centre de producció i recerca d'arts visuals">Hangar</a>, centre de producció artística en Barcelona.</p>
