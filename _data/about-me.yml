  <h1 class="title text-center">The Artist Says</h1>
  <p>"You are an artist? So what do you do?".
  <br/>
  I always respond differently, depends on who is asking. I'd say I do projects for YOU.
  </p>

  <p>YOU, if you are a potential audience.

  <br/>If you work for an audience, it's not enough that everybody listens to you. It's the ONE I care for. </p>

  <p>I tear down barriers between audience and artist, between the work and the observer. I question authorities.
  <br/>Ask a lot. Listen. </p>
  <p >So far my formats are online calls, blogs, performances, collages, talks, stop motion, audio and video.<br/>It depends on the project.</p>

  <p>If you'd like to know more, please don't hesitate to write me a card, a letter, a <a href="mailto:contact@christinaschultz.com">mail</a>.
  <br/>Or come and see me at my residency at <a href="http://hangar.org" title="Hangar, Centre de producció i recerca d'arts visuals">Hangar</a>, centre de producció artística en Barcelona.</p>
